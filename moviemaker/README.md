## Encode video frame by frame in C++ using FFmpeg

<img src="screenshot.png" width="200"/>

Results of scientific or engineering simulations are often needed to be recorded on-the-fly. That is, the volume of data is often inapplicable to saving all individual frames on disk and postprocess them into video afterwards. This library leverages FFmpeg to embed video encoding directly into frame-producing application:

```cpp
#include "movie.h"

#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

...

const unsigned int width = 1024;
const unsigned int height = 768;
const unsigned int nframes = 128;

MovieWriter movie("random_pixels", width, height);

vector<uint8_t> pixels(4 * width * height);
for (unsigned int iframe = 0; iframe < nframes; iframe++)
{
        for (unsigned int j = 0; j < height; j++)
                for (unsigned int i = 0; i < width; i++)
                {
                        pixels[4 * width * j + 4 * i + 0] = rand() % 256;
                        pixels[4 * width * j + 4 * i + 1] = rand() % 256;
                        pixels[4 * width * j + 4 * i + 2] = rand() % 256;
                        pixels[4 * width * j + 4 * i + 3] = rand() % 256;
                }

        movie.addFrame(&pixels[0]);
}
```

Additionally, the library offers an interface to encode SVG images.
